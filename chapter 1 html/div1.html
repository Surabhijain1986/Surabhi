           he death toll was rising in Central European countries on Sunday after days of heavy rains caused widespread flooding and forced mass evacuations.

            Several Central European nations have already been hit by severe flooding, including Austria, the Czech Republic, Poland and Romania, while Slovakia and Hungary might come next, as a result of a low pressure system from northern Italy dumping record rainfall in the region since Thursday.</h3>
